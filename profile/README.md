The South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative is a clinical research centre, located within the Health Sciences Faculty at the University of Cape Town.
SATVI's mission is the development of new and effective vaccination strategies against TB and has a strong TB clinical immunology laboratory.
We provide data and code via GitHub to reproduce our analyses, as well as packages implementing our own algorithms and small packages extending others.

We use a consistent naming system, with the following prefixes indicating the purpose of the repository:

- DataTidy: processes data
- Analysis: analyses data
- Report: details and summarises analyses
- Pipeline: project-specific functions
- Utils: extend existing packages with utility functions
- Minor: very small self-contained analyses
