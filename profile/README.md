## Hi there 👋

The South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative is a TB clinical trial organisation with a strong TB immunology arm.

We provide data and code via GitHub to reproduce our analyses, as well as small extension packages and packages implementing our own algorithms.

We use a consistent naming system, with the following prefixes indicating the purpose of the repository:

- DataTidy: processes data
- Analysis: analyses data
- Report: details and summarises analyses
- Pipeline: project-specific functions
- Utils: extend existing packages with utility functions
